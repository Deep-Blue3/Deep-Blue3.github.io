## Unscramble the logo
1. **Submarine Icon**: The main element of the logo is a submarine with a fish tail design, directly representing the core of your project—underwater detection and search capabilities. The submarine symbolizes the ability to explore deep oceans, indicating that your design can operate in complex and profound underwater environments.
2. **Wave Pattern**: The waves beneath the submarine symbolize the aquatic environment, emphasizing the application context of your design. These waves not only represent the ocean but also metaphorically suggest the fluidity and adaptability of the technology, showcasing the flexibility and functionality of your design.
3. **Colors**: The logo features deep blue and light blue colors. Deep blue symbolizes the deep sea and the determination to explore unknown territories, while light blue represents clarity and hope, conveying the reliability and efficiency of your design in rescue and search operations.
4. **Text**: The phrase "The Deep Blue Explorer" clearly conveys the mission of your design—exploring the deep sea. This name is not only straightforward but also evokes a sense of adventure, inspiring curiosity and a desire to explore the unknown.
