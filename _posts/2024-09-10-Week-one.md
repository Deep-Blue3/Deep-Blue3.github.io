*On September 10, 2024, our team members Yiming Wang, Yunhe Zhao, Huanting Fang met with our supervisor Yinglong Chen and had a preliminary discussion on issues related to our graduation project. In our first team meeting on underwater rescue search robots, the entire team successfully clarified the core goals and key tasks of the project. This meeting laid the foundation for the smooth progress of the project and ensured that all team members had a clear understanding of the project's direction and expected outcomes.*

## Introduction
Firstly, each team member introduced themselves, sharing their backgrounds, academic achievements, professional skills, and roles in the project. This not only promotes understanding among team members, but also provides a basis for subsequent division of labor and responsibility allocation. We have allocated specific tasks reasonably based on each person's expertise, ensuring that each link has a responsible person and enhancing the transparency and efficiency of project execution.
## Project overview
Subsequently, we discussed in detail the overview and objectives of the project. Professor Chen fully introduced to us the development background and importance of underwater rescue and search robots. This clarifies the application value of this technology in practical rescue scenarios. The main goals of our project include achieving efficient underwater search, real-time data transmission, and high pressure resistance, which provide clear direction for subsequent design and development.
## Plan and schedule 
The project plan and schedule are another important topic of discussion at the meeting. We have divided the project into several main stages, including design, development, testing, and deployment, with specific timelines set for each stage. At the same time, we agreed on the frequency of mentor meetings. Through a detailed schedule, we are able to effectively track project progress, identify and resolve issues in a timely manner, and ensure that the project progresses as planned.
## Resources and budget
In terms of resources and budget, we have roughly estimated the various resources and funding sources required for the project, as well as the allocation method, to ensure that resources can be utilized reasonably.
## Contact and communication
To ensure efficient communication and collaboration within the team, we have identified commonly used communication channels and tools such as email, WeChat groups, etc. We can post relevant videos and links in WeChat groups for everyone to discuss and think about. This also facilitates us to regularly update project progress and discuss issues, ensuring smooth information flow and timely resolution of problems.
## Expected result 
Finally, we discussed the expected outcomes and evaluation criteria of the project. The expected outcomes of the project have been clearly defined, including the production of fully functional robots, technical documentation, and testing reports.
## Conclusion
Through this meeting, we have laid a solid foundation for the smooth implementation of the project, established effective communication and collaboration mechanisms, and ensured efficient progress of future work. We are confident that through the joint efforts of the team, we can successfully complete this graduation project.
