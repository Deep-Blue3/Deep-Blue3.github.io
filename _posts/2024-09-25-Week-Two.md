*This week, the group's work progressed smoothly and achieved remarkable results*

On Monday, we met with instructor Chen Yinglong and clarified the task of the underwater search robot. After in-depth discussions, it was determined that the task would be divided into three parts: modeling, programming, and assembly, pointing out the direction for the follow-up work. 

After clarifying the task, the group members took quick action. We divided the work reasonably and each performed their own duties. Members responsible for modeling actively conceived the appearance and structure of the robot, striving to design a model that is both practical and beautiful. Programmers began to plan the software architecture to lay the foundation for realizing various functions of the robot. Assemblers also familiarized themselves with relevant components in advance to prepare for the subsequent assembly work.

In addition, we also made a promotional PPT for the group's underwater robot. From the functional characteristics to the application prospects of the robot, detailed presentations were made. This PPT is not only a summary of our work but also lays a good foundation for the subsequent project promotion.
